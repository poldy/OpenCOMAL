# OpenCOMAL

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/poldy/OpenCOMAL/wiki) for most of the
documentation.

(Tá [leagan Gaeilge](LÉIGHMÉ.md) den cáipéis seo ar fáil.)

This is a patched version of [Jos Visser](http://www.josvisser.nl/)'s
[OpenComal](http://www.josvisser.nl/opencomal/)
[0.2.7](http://www.josvisser.nl/opencomal/opencomal-0.2.7-pre1-work.tar.gz) (unstable branch).

## FAQ

### Why this fork?

The previous maintainer, pietsch <https://github.com/pietsch>, fixed
bugs so that OpenComal could run on then-current versions of Linux.

I took over the project because I am interested in practical
methods for improving the quality of old projects (similar to the
[ntpsec](https://www.ntpsec.org/) project, although I am still
some way behind them). OpenComal is a nice size to run experiments
on.

One of the nice things about the COMAL language itself is
that it has a vendor-neutral standard with several implementions.
Lately I've also been trying to bring OpenComal closer to compliance
with those standards:

* [COMAL Kernel spec](http://datamuseum.dk/wiki/COMAL/standardization#TeleNova.2C_Nyn.C3.A4shamn.2C_Sweden._March_13_to_16.2C_1985)
* [Common COMAL](https://archive.org/download/COMAL_Today_Issue_24), pages 21-46
* [The "Type Detector" package](samples/examples/computer.md)
* [The "STANDARD" package](samples/examples/standard.md)

One regression is that I removed support for platforms that I don't
build and test, MS-DOS and Win32.
I am no longer interested in these systems, or pull requests for them.
Just in case anyone wanted to fork,
the last version containing the needed files is tagged as `last_dos_w32_version`.

### Does Jos Visser, the original author, endorse this fork?

I don't know.
Emails sent to his address no longer seem to be read.
Legally there should not
be any problem because OpenComal is licensed under the GPL.

### I do not see a new line number after entering `auto`. Is this wrong?

Never mind, just type anything, and it will appear. Or hit the
backspace key first (kudos to Harald Arnesen for this hint).

### When will you implement feature X?

I'm reluctant to do this, unless the feature is in one of the above
standards. I *am* interested in bug reports and pull requests
though. I think OpenCOMAL definitely has a niche in retrocomputing
and may possibly have one in education, e.g. for children, teenagers, or
other domain experts
that don't have time to learn Computer Science.
